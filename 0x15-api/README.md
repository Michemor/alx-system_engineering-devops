#### Python | Scripting | Back-end | API

## Project Scope

### APIs

Old school system admins used Bash for most of their scripting. While Bash
is fine for most things, it can get messy and and is inefficient as compared 
to other programming languages.
As a result, this project employs Python programming language for scripting
and wotking with APIs.
APIs stand for Application Programming Interface which are tools that provide for
communication between two software components.
An example is an application that displays the weather updates to its users.
The developer's application will use an API to interact with the weather's server
and fetch some data that would be displayed to the user.
The application could be a part of software that performs a distinct function.
The interface would describe some rules that govern how the two systems will
exchange data in the form of requests and responses.
A REST api is a type of API that stands for Representational State Transfer that
uses a client-server architecture.
REST APIs return data in JSON format.

### The Pythonic Way

The Pythonic Way defines code that uses the correct syntax, is readable, clear,
and maintainable.
Pythonic code conforms to the following principles: readable, clear and simple.
This means that the code is simple, clean and easy for everyone to understand.

        _________PYTHONIC__________
       \|       - readable        \|
       \|       - simple          \|
       \|       - clean           \|

packages, functions, and constants in the pythonic way
