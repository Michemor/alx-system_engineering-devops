# 0x13. Firewall
#### DevOps | SysAdmin | Security


A firewall is a software or hardware used to monitor and filter incoming and
outgoing traffic from a network or device depending on where it has been setup.
Firewalls are divided into two based on their use:
- Network-based firewall: used to protect networks i.e. set up between a LAN and 
WAN
- Host-based firewall: used to protect a host. Set up in the host machine

For this project we used a ufw firewall set up on web-01 server
